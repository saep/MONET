            <h3>About MONET</h3>

            <p>
            	This is a platform which was designed to facilitate the development and experimental comparison of (multi-objective) graph algorithms written in Java.
            	<span class="box box_embedded_hint">
					<b>Hint:</b> As of this writing, only java code is supported, but it is absolutely possible to include source code of any other language.
            	</span>
            	It offers a convenient, easy to learn and easy to master graphical user interface - based on a solid and powerful framework - for the <b>generation, observation and empirical comparison</b> of experiments.
            </p>

            <h4>Quickstart</h4>
            <p>
            	The MONET platform is based on stuff like experiments, jobs, workers and so on. This concepts are explained in detail in the <a wicket:id="link.documentation" href="#">MONET documentation</a>. Moreover there are helpful hints spread over the software which aim to help you if you get stuck at some place.
