## Writing documentation

To write documentation you simply need access to the documentation files of the
controlserver. The controlserver has a configuration option that allows setting
the path in which the documentation files are present.

If you have access to those files, you simply edit them and it will be reflected
directly in the frontend. You only have to follow a few simple rules:

* you may not (yet) create folders in the documentation folder
* the files must end with '.md' and they must be valid markdown syntax
* the first two characters of the file name are ignored as they are used to sort
  the different documentation files
* anything between the 2 reserved characters and the '.md' suffix will be the
  text shown in the side bar of the documentation page

That's it!
