/**
 * An experiment as created by an user. One Experiment is a collection of jobs
 * to be executed on one or more workers.
 *
 * All jobs of one Experiment execute the same algorithm (in name and version)
 * and parameters, but may differ in the input instance. This is called the
 * Experiment Contract.
 *
 * The user may assign a number of workers that the experiment must use
 * exclusively. If no workers are assigned to an experiment the
 * {@link Scheduler} may use any worker.
 *
 * The exact state of an Experiment is highly complex as all jobs have their own
 * state. The Experiment has its own state that abstracts the states of all its
 * jobs. If this state changes any observers of an Experiments are notified with
 * the new state.
 *
 * In order to commit changes made to an Experiment you need to call its
 * {@link #save()} method. This method should be called whenever you have
 * changed any number of properties and won't change any more properties for the
 * moment.
